Preview: Example Images in MetaDataset
====================================================================================================
For each image class (e.g. *Dogs*), the MetaDataset contains different sets of dogs under different contexts to represent diverse data distributions. The contexts include presence/absence of other objects (e.g. *dog with frisbee*). Contexts can also reflect attributes (e.g. *black dogs*) and general settings (e.g. *dogs in sunny weather*). These concepts thus captures diverse and real-world distribution shifts. We list the attribute and general location contexts below.

   **Figure: Infographics of MetaDataset.** We leverage the natural heterogeneity of Visual Genome and its annotations to construct MetaDataset. MetaDataset is a collection of 12,868 sets of natural images from 410 classes. Each class has 31.4 subsets, and each subset has 200.4 images on average. 
   Each class also has is also associated with a meta-graph. 
   The subsets are characterized by a diverse collection of 1,853 distinct contexts.
